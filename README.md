# wasm-retro-gamekit

My goal is to build a minimalist toolkit for Retro-style browser games with Rust + WASM.

This project is currently "pre-alpha", changing quickly, and undocumented.



## Demos

[Examples of simple games built with `wasm-retro-gamekit`](demos).


## Development

### Build with `wasm-pack build`

```
wasm-pack build
```

### Test in Headless Browsers with `wasm-pack test`

```
wasm-pack test --headless --firefox
```
